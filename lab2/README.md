Lab-2 

You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
Enter a name
Search for a name
Remove a name
Show all names
Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.
Constraints:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
Format your results properly!!
